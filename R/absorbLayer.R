#' Absorb a layer into its surrounding color patches
#'
# Every component of a layer which satisfies a size and location condition is
# 'absorbed' into the color map by switching its color to that of the color
# patch with which it shares the longest border. Useful for dealing with
# reflections, gloss, speckles, small features, etc.

#' @param recolorize_obj A `recolorize` object.
#' @param layer_idx The numeric index of the layer to absorb.
#' @param size_condition A condition for determining which components to absorb,
#' written as a function. The default (`function(l) l <= Inf`) will affect
#' all components, since they all have fewer than infinity pixels.
#' @param x_range,y_range The rectangular bounding box (as proportions of the
#'   image width and length) for selecting patches. Patches with at least
#'   partial overlap are counted. Defaults (0-1) include the entire image.
#'   See details.
#' @param remove_empty_layers Logical. If the layer is completely absorbed,
#'   remove it from the layer indices and renumber the existing patches? (Example:
#'   if you completely absorb layer 3, then layer 4 -> 3 and 5 -> 4, and so on).
#' @param highlight_color Color for highlighting the affected layer.
#' @param plotting Logical. Plot results?
#'
#' @return A `recolorize` object.
#'
#' @details This function works by splitting a layer into spatially distinct
#' 'components' using [imager::split_connected]. A contiguous region of pixels
#' is considered a single component. Only components which satisfy
#' both the `size_condition` and the location condition (specified via `x_range`
#' and `y_range`) are absorbed, so you can be target specific regions with
#' (ideally) a minimum of fuss.
#'
#' The `size_condition` is passed as a function which must have a logical
#' vector output (`TRUE` and `FALSE`) when applied to a vector of sizes.
#' Usually this will be some combination of greater and less than statements,
#' combined with logical operators like `&` and `|`. For example,
#' `size_condition = function(x) x > 100 | x < 10` would affect components of
#' greater than 100 pixels and fewer than 10 pixels, but not those with 10-100
#' pixels.
#'
#' The `x_range` and `y_range` values set the bounding box of a rectangular
#' region as proportions of the image axes, with the origin (0, 0) in the bottom
#' left corner. Any patch which has at least partial overlap with this bounding
#' box will be considered to satisfy the condition. When selecting this region,
#' it can be helpful to plot a grid on the image first to narrow down an
#' approximate region (see examples).
#'
#'
#' @seealso [editLayers] for editing layers using morphological operations;
#' [thresholdRecolor] for re-fitting the entire image without minor colors.

#' # this looks okay, but the brown patch (3) has some speckling
#' # in the upper right elytron due to reflection, and the orange
#' # patch (4) has the same issue
#'
#' # the brown patch is easier to deal with, since size thresholding alone is
#' # sufficient; we want to leave the stripes intact, so we'll absorb components
#' # that are 50-250 pixels OR fewer than 20 pixels (to get the tiny speckles),

#' # what about the orange speckles? this is more difficult, because
#' # we want to retain the border around the brown stripes, but those patches
#' # are quite small, so size thresholding won't work
