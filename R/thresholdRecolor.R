#' Drop minor colors from a recolorize object
#'
#' Drops color patches whose cumulative sum (as a proportion of total pixels
#' assigned) is equal to or less than `pct`, so that only the dominant
#' color patches remain, and refits the object with the reduced set of
#' color centers Useful for dropping spurious detail colors.
#'
#' @param recolorize_obj An object of class `recolorize`.
#' @param pct The proportion cutoff (0-1) for dropping color patches. The
#' higher this value is, the more/larger color centers will be dropped.
#' @param plotting Logical. Plot the results?
#' @param ... Further arguments passed to [recolorize::imposeColors], which is
#'   called for refitting a new recolorize object for the reduced set of
#'   clusters.
#'
#' @details This function is fairly simple in execution: the color centers are
#'   arranged by their sizes, largest to smallest, and their cumulative sum is
#'   calculated. The minimum number of color centers to reach a cumulative sum
#'   equal to or greater than the cutoff (`1 - pct`) is retained, and these
#'   dominant colors are used to re-fit the image. Despite being
#'   straightforward, this can be a surprisingly useful function.
#'
#' @return A `recolorize` object.
